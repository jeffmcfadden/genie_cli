# TDD CLI

TDD CLI is a command-line tool that brings Test Driven Development (TDD) principles to life by integrating with a large language model (LLM) through the `ruby_llm` library. It provides an interactive session where you can ask the AI assistant to write tests, implement code, and manage your codebaseâ€”all while enforcing a strict TDD workflow.

## Features

- Interactive REPL-style session powered by OpenAI (or any provider supported by `ruby_llm`).
- Built-in tools for common file operations:
  - `ListFiles`: List and filter files in your project directory.
  - `ReadFile`: Read the contents of files.
  - `WriteFile`: Create or overwrite files.
  - `InsertIntoFile`: Insert content at a specific marker in a file.
  - `AppendToFile`: Append content to existing files.
  - `RunTests`: Run your test suite and capture results.
  - `TakeANote`: Write notes without affecting your source files.
  - `AskForHelp`: Request guidance or explanations from the AI.
- Enforces TDD workflow: tests first, implementation second.
- Restricts file operations to your project directory for safety.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tdd_cli.git
   cd tdd_cli
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Bundler:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider keys) in your environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. Make the CLI executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bin/tdd
   ```

## Usage

Start a TDD session by running the `tdd` command from the root of your project:

```bash
./bin/tdd ["initial prompt or command"]
```

- If you provide an initial prompt, the assistant will immediately respond. Otherwise, you'll enter an interactive prompt where you can type your questions or commands.
- To quit the session, type `q`, `quit`, `done`, or `exit`.

Example session:

```bash
$ ./bin/tdd
Starting a new session with:

 > "Implement Calculator#add to pass the test"

# (AI writes the implementation)

 > "Run the test suite"

# (AI invokes `rake test` and reports results)

 > "exit"

## Configuration

Configuration is handled via environment variables and the `ruby_llm` initializer in `lib/tdd.rb`:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
- `ANOTHER_PROVIDER_KEY`: If using another LLM provider, set it here.
- `RUBY_LLM_LOG_FILE`: Path to the `ruby_llm` log file (default: `ruby_llm.log`).
- `RUBY_LLM_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, etc.).

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite. Run all tests with:

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```

# Genie CLI

Genie CLI is a command-line tool that brings Test Driven Development (TDD) 
principles to life by integrating with a large language model (LLM) through 
the `ruby_llm` library. It provides an interactive session where you can ask 
the AI assistant to write tests, implement code, and manage your codebaseâ€”all 
while enforcing a strict TDD workflow.

## Features

- Interactive REPL-style session powered by OpenAI (or any provider supported by `ruby_llm`).
- Built-in tools for common file operations:
  - `ListFiles`: List and filter files in your project directory.
  - `ReadFile`: Read the contents of files.
  - `WriteFile`: Create or overwrite files.
  - `InsertIntoFile`: Insert content at a specific marker in a file.
  - `AppendToFile`: Append content to existing files.
  - `RunTests`: Run your test suite and capture results.
  - `TakeANote`: Write notes without affecting your source files.
  - `AskForHelp`: Request guidance or explanations from the AI.
- Enforces Genie workflow: tests first, implementation second.
- Restricts file operations to your project directory for safety.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeffmcfadden/genie_cli.git
   cd genie_cli
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Bundler:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider keys) in your environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. Make the CLI executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bin/genie
   ```

## Usage

Start a Genie session by running the `genie` command from the root of your project:

```bash
./bin/genie ["initial prompt or command"]
```

- If you provide an initial prompt, the assistant will immediately respond. Otherwise, you'll enter an interactive prompt where you can type your questions or commands.
- To quit the session, type `q`, `quit`, `done`, or `exit`.

Example session:

```bash
$ ./bin/genie
Starting a new session with:
 base_path: /Users/you/projects/genie_cli

 > "Create a failing test for a Calculator#add method"

# (AI writes a test file)

 > "Implement Calculator#add to pass the test"

# (AI writes the implementation)

 > "Run the test suite"

# (AI invokes `rake test` and reports results)

 > "exit"

## Logging

The output of `genie` to the terminal includes "essential" output, but not 
_all_ output. To aid in debugging, the full RubyLLM debug log is saved to 
`ruby_llm.log`. This can be useful for auditing what's happened during a 
session in great detail.

## Configuration

Configuration is available via a `genie.yml` file in the project root.

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite. Run all tests with:

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```
